 * @brief This is the doxygen generated HTML documentation of libflocke
 * @endbrief
 *
 * libflocke contains some program components building upon libschnee.
 * There are several reasons why components could be in libflocke
 * - There are not stable enough
 * - There are not generic enough (made for specific applications)
 * - There have to be shared between different applications, so they are not
 *   part of the applications.
 *
 * Components in libflocke tend to change often and not to be API stable (yet).
