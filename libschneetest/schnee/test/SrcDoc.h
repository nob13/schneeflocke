 * @brief This is the doxygen generated HTML documentation of libschneetest.
 * @endbrief
 *
 * libschneetest contains some often used classes for testcase development for libschnee.
 *
 * From importance are:
 * - The Network simulation sf::test::Network.
 * - The simulated network bridge to the GenericInterplexBeacon, sf::test::NetworkDispatcher
 * - A local loop-back Channel implementation, sf::test::LocalChannel.
 *
 * Application build with libschnee should not link to this library, this is just testing code.
